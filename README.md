## Features ‚ú®

- **Automated Trading**: Executes sandwich trades without manual intervention.
- **Mempool Monitoring**: Keeps an eye on large transactions to identify trading opportunities.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjust settings to suit your trading strategy.
- **Support for Raydium and Orca**: Works with popular Solana DEXs.
- **Educational Use**: Designed for learning and experimentation.

## How It Works üîç

The Solana Sandwich Bot operates by:

1. **Monitoring the Mempool**: It continuously checks for large transactions in the mempool.
2. **Front-Running**: When it detects a large buy order, the bot places a buy order just before the large transaction to benefit from the price increase.
3. **Back-Running**: After the large transaction occurs, the bot places a sell order to take advantage of the price impact.

This process allows the bot to profit from the difference in prices before and after the large transaction.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

Before running the bot, you need to configure it. Open the `config.json` file and set the following parameters:

- **API Key**: Your Solana DEX API key.
- **Trading Pairs**: The pairs you want to trade (e.g., SOL/USDC).
- **Front-Run Threshold**: The minimum amount of profit you want to make from front-running.
- **Back-Run Threshold**: The minimum amount of profit you want to make from back-running.

Here‚Äôs an example of what the `config.json` might look like:

```json
{
  "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  "trading_pairs": ["SOL/USDC"],
  "front_run_threshold": 0.01,
  "back_run_threshold": 0.01
}
```
